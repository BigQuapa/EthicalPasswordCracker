# EthicalPasswordCracker
ETHICALPasswordCracker is a Python-based, multi-threaded brute-force password cracker designed for educational and cybersecurity training. It demonstrates how brute-force attacks work on both plain-text passwords and hashed values like SHA-256. Intended strictly for ethical use and cybersecurity awareness.

This project demonstrates the basic mechanics of password cracking using brute-force methods, allowing users to:

Crack known passwords using character combinations

Crack unknown passwords by matching hashed values (e.g., SHA-256)

Utilize multi-threading for faster and more efficient cracking

Track time taken to crack a password

**Disclaimer**
This tool is strictly intended for educational purposes, cybersecurity training, and authorized ethical use.
Do not use this software on systems or accounts you do not own or have permission to test. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

**Features**
Brute-force attack on known passwords

Offline cracking of hashed passwords (SHA-256 supported)

Multi-threaded operation for performance

Fully configurable character sets (lowercase, uppercase, digits)

Displays time taken for successful password cracks

Beginner-friendly Python code with detailed comments

**Quick Start**
Clone the repository and run the program:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ETHICALPasswordCracker.git
cd ETHICALPasswordCracker
python ethical_password_cracker.py
